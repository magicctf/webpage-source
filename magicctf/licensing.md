which **was** fully compatible with the Minetest forum rules.

All other stuff was made by LMD and is licensed under **GPLv3**, if not otherwise stated.
As the Gullskoe font is licensed under **CC-BY-NC**, all textures of this game that are based on that font are therefore licensed under **CC-BY-NC**.
The textures based on jp's enchantment table texture(magic tables, treasure spawners) **keeps the license**.
