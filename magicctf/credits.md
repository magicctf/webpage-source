Your Enchantment Table Texture was very useful as it looks really good and offered a nice base :)
The following textures are based on it : 
* Red Magic Table : just copied
* Blue Magic Table : copied and colorized
* Treasure Spawner : copied but simplified & colorized

Your hudbars mod is very stable and looks magnificient. The mana bar is an addition that is very useful for a magical themed (sub)game. Great work ! Thank you very much for that.

The arrow model & code and your shooter textures are a nice help ! And 3d_armor is a complex mod that does it job really well, so : Just amazing !
Thanks alot.

MTG is just basic when creating a (sub)game. It's overwhelming stable & well made. Good job !

I guess I don't have to give any explanations why WorldEdit is **essential** for large buildings. For sure one of the most popular mods on MT servers ! Keep up the good work !
