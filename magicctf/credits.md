Your Enchantment Table Texture was very useful as it looks really good and offered a nice base :)
The following textures are based on it : 
* Red Magic Table : just copied
* Blue Magic Table : copied and colorized
* Treasure Spawner : copied but simplified & colorize

 __Odd Einar Haugen__
---------------------

The [Gullskoen](https://folk.uib.no/hnooh/runefont/Gullskoen-e.html) Font by __Odd Einar Haugen__ offers authentic, high-quality runes which helped alot when we were in need for runes. They are used within the Runestones, the Progress Bar(see Texture Packs), and the logo. Probably also elsewhere in this game and the additional resources...
The Gullskoe Font is licensed under **CC-BY-NC**.
All textures of this game that are based on the Gullskoe Rune Font are therefore licensed under **CC-BY-NC**.

Your hudbars mod is very stable and looks magnificient. The mana bar is an addition that is very useful for a magical themed (sub)game. Great work ! Thank you very much for that.
It is very kind and generous of you that you licensed **all stuff by you that I know** under **extremely free** licenses.

The arrow model & code and your shooter textures are a nice help ! And 3d_armor is a complex mod that does it job really well, so : Just amazing !
Thanks alot.

GunshipPenguin

Your sprint mod comes in very handy ! Neat and well balanced ! Works perfect.

MTG is just basic when creating a (sub)game. It's overwhelming stable & well made. Good job !

I guess I don't have to give any explanations why WorldEdit is **essential** for large buildings. For sure one of the most popular mods on MT servers ! Keep up the good work !
