About Magic-CTF
===============

Aim
---

Magic-CTF is a new CTF Game for Minetest. It is an important goal to have a strong magical component.
Therefore, the game tries to look & feel somehow magical-medieval - accordingly, the HUD has been altered.
Other than rubenwardy's CTF, it doesnt focus on removing stuff to keep the game focused, but instead aims at adding even more.
That should lead to a more interesting gameplay. Players should be encouraged to develop their own strategies.

**The long-term goal is to make Magic-CTF the best & most popular server game for Minetest.**

Required Minetest Version
-------------------------

Magic-CTF was developed & tested on Minetest `0.4.17.1`, but should be compatible with `0.4.16.x` as well, because `4.17` is said to be a bugfix-only release. It is most likely also usable on MT `> 0.4.13`.
It has several incompatibilities with `5.0.0`, due to player position change.
