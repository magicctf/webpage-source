Further hints : 

* Use improved boats or gliders, as they provide far more HP and placing one takes time.
* Try to hide Rune Signal Systems to prevent the enemies from modifying or destroying them.
* Carts are included ! Build rails to reach the enemy faster.
* Collect potions to be safe on your way home when attempting to steal their book(flag).
